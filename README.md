# Swiss Music Generator
This project was created in the course **Computational Perception extended COMPPX** from Chiara KÃ¼hne and Dominik Maag from the Digital Ideation at HSLU.

## Idea
Our idea was to train a model with Swiss dialect songs to generate our own Swiss song text. We were surprised how well the model copes with the different Swiss dialects and inconsistent spelling.

To make the result accessible to others, we have developed a frontend with which everyone can generate their own Swiss dialect song.

## Process
We have compiled a dataset of 200 Swiss dialect songs from [songtexte.com)] (https://www.songtexte.com/) from different artists in a txt file. With these we trained the ML5 CharRNN model. We tried in different steps with more and more songs and different number of runs, how the result comes out, until we were satisfied. Then we exported the model so that we could generate song lyrics locally in a selfcreated frontend.

## Frontend
The Frondend is developed with HTML, CSS and JS. The user can typ a word in the input field and click "Text generieren". The generated text output will start with the entered word.

## Usage
You can download the files, open it with a local live server and generate your own songtext.
